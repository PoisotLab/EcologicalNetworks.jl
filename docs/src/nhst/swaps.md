# Network permutations

As opposed to re-generating networks from a template of probabilities, network
permutations shuffles interactions within a network. This is done by enforcing
different constraints on degree distribution: either only the fill is
maintained, or only the in or out degree, or both.

It is also possible to produce a single permutation of a network if needed.
