We propose here a straightforward approach for quantifying nestedness using quantitative instead of presence–absence data. We named our estimator WNODF because it is a simple modification of the nestedness index called NODF. We also introduce the NODF-Program that calculates the above described nestedness metrics as well as metrics for idiosyncratic species and sites. Statistical inference is done through a null model approach, in which the user can choose among five null models commonly used for presence–absence matrices as well as three randomization algorithms for matrices that contain quantitative data. The program performs multiple analyses using many matrices. Finally, the NODF-Program provides four sorting options that, together with the null algorithms, cover a range of possibilities to test hypotheses on the possible mechanisms producing nested patterns. By using a set of model matrices, we showed that WNODF differentiates nested matrices with distinct structures and correctly identifies matrices with no nested pattern as having zero degree of nestedness.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815210002306","DOI":"10.1016/j.envsoft.2010.08.003","ISSN":"1364-8152","author":[{"family":"Almeida-Neto","given":"Mário"},{"family":"Ulrich","given":"Werner"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,2]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,28]]},"container-title-short":"Environmental Modelling & Software"},

This article is intended for beginners who are interested in programming their own network visualizations, or for those curious about some of the basic mechanics of graph visualization. Four easy-to-program network layout techniques are discussed, with details given for implementing each one: force-directed node-link diagrams, arc diagrams, adjacency matrices, and circular layouts. A Java applet demonstrating these layouts, with open source code, is available at http://www.michaelmcguffin.com/research/simpleNetVis/.
