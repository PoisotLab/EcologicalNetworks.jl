In this example, we will show how the modular structure of an ecological network
can be optimized. Finding the optimal modular structure can be a time-consuming
process, as it relies on heuristic which are not guaranteed to converge to the
global maximum. There is no elegant alternative to trying multiple approaches,
repeating the process multiple times, and having some luck.

```@example modularity
using EcologicalNetworks
using EcologicalNetworksPlots
using Plots
using Plots.PlotMeasures
```

## Generating modular partitions

For the first approach, we will generate random partitions of the species across
3 to 12 modules, and evaluate 20 replicate attempts for each of these
combinations. The output we are interested in is the number of modules, and the
overall modularity.

```@example modularity
N = convert(BipartiteNetwork, web_of_life("M_PA_003"))

n = repeat(3:12, outer=20)
m = Array{Dict}(undef, length(n))

for i in eachindex(n)
  # Each run returns the network and its modules
  # We discard the network, and assign the modules to our object
  _, m[i] = n_random_modules(n[i])(N) |> x -> brim(x...)
end
```

```@example modularity
q = map(x -> Q(N,x), m);
c = (m .|> values |> collect) .|> unique .|> length;
```

```@example modularity
p1 = scatter(c, q, c=:grey, msw=0.0, leg=false, frame=:origin, grid=false, margin = 10mm)
xaxis!(p1, "Number of modules")
yaxis!(p1, "Modularity", (0, 0.5))
```

## Measuring modularity

Now that we have the modular partition for every attempt, we can count the
modules in it, and measure its modularity. Out of all attempts, we want to get
the most modular one, *i.e.* the one with highest modularity. In some simple
problems, there may be several partitions with the highest value, so we can
either take the first, or one at random:

```@example modularity
optimal = rand(findall(q.== maximum(q)));
best_m = m[optimal];
```

This can be plotted using `EcologicalNetworksPlots`:

```@example modularity
I = initial(RandomInitialLayout, N)
for step in 1:4000
  position!(SpringElectric(1.2; gravity=0.1), I, N)
end
p2 = plot(I, N, aspectratio=1)
scatter!(p2, I, N, bipartite=true, nodefill=best_m, markercolor=:isolum)
```

## Species functional roles

We can finally look at the functional roles of the species:

```@example modularity
roles = functional_cartography(N, best_m)
```

This function returns a tuple (an unmodifiable set of values) of coordinates for
every species, indicating its within-module contribution, and its participation
coefficient. These results can be plotted to separate species in module hubs,
network hubs, peripherals, and connectors. Note that in the context of
ecological networks, this classification is commonly used. It derives from
previous work on metabolic networks, which subdivides the plane in 7 (rather
than 4) regions. For the sake of completeness, we have added the 7 regions to
the plot as well.

```@example modularity
plot(Shape([-2, 2.5, 2.5, -2], [0, 0, 0.05, 0.05]), lab="", frame=:box, lc=:grey, opacity=0.3, c=:grey, lw=0.0, grid=false, margin = 10mm) #R1
plot!(Shape([-2, 2.5, 2.5, -2], [0.05, 0.05, 0.62, 0.62]), lab="", c=:transparent) #R2
plot!(Shape([-2, 2.5, 2.5, -2], [0.62, 0.62, 0.80, 0.80]), lab="", lc=:grey, opacity=0.3, c=:grey, lw=0.0) #R3
plot!(Shape([-2, 2.5, 2.5, -2], [0.80, 0.80, 1.0, 1.0]), lab="", c=:transparent) #R4

plot!(Shape([2.5, 3.0, 3.0, 2.5], [0, 0, 0.3, 0.3]), lab="", c=:transparent) #R5
plot!(Shape([2.5, 3.0, 3.0, 2.5], [0.3, 0.3, 0.75, 0.75]), lab="", lc=:grey, opacity=0.3, c=:grey, lw=0.0) #R6
plot!(Shape([2.5, 3.0, 3.0, 2.5], [0.75, 0.75, 1.0, 1.0]), lab="", c=:transparent) #R7

vline!([2.5], c=:black, ls=:dot, lw=2.0)
hline!([0.62], c=:black, ls=:dot, lw=2.0)
collect(values(roles)) |> x -> scatter!(x, leg=false, c=:white)
yaxis!("Among-module connectivity", (0,1))
xaxis!("Within-module degree", (-2, 3))
```
