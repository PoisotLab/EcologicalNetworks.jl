There is almost no information on the structural organization of species-rich mutualistic networks despite its potential importance for the maintenance of diversity. Here we analyze 52 mutualistic networks and show that they are highly nested; that is, the more specialist species interact only with proper subsets of those species interacting with the more generalists. This assembly pattern generates highly asymmetrical interactions and organizes the community cohesively around a central core of interactions. Thus, mutualistic networks are neither randomly assembled nor organized in compartments arising from tight, parallel specialization. Furthermore, nestedness increases with the complexity (number of interactions) of the network: for a given number of species, communities with more interactions are significantly more nested. Our results indicate a nonrandom pattern of community organization that may be relevant for our understanding of the organization and persistence of biodiversity.","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1633576100","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1633576100","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Bascompte","given":"J."},{"family":"Jordano","given":"P."},{"family":"Melian","given":"C.

We also introduce the NODF-Program that calculates the above described nestedness metrics as well as metrics for idiosyncratic species and sites. Statistical inference is done through a null model approach, in which the user can choose among five null models commonly used for presence–absence matrices as well as three randomization algorithms for matrices that contain quantitative data. The program performs multiple analyses using many matrices. Finally, the NODF-Program provides four sorting options that, together with the null algorithms, cover a range of possibilities to test hypotheses on the possible mechanisms producing nested patterns. By using a set of model matrices, we showed that WNODF differentiates nested matrices with distinct structures and correctly identifies matrices with no nested pattern as having zero degree of nestedness.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815210002306","DOI":"10.1016/j.envsoft.2010.08.003","ISSN":"1364-8152","author":[{"family":"Almeida-Neto","given":"Mário"},{"family":"Ulrich","given":"Werner"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,2]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,28]]},"container-title-short":"Environmental Modelling & Software"},

The integration of biogeography and network theory will yield important results and further our understanding of species interactions. It has, however, been hampered so far by the difficulty to quantify variation among interaction networks. Here, we propose a general framework to study the dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into interactions and species turnover components, so that it is immediately comparable to common measures of β-diversity. We emphasise that scaling up β-diversity of community composition to the β-diversity of interactions requires only a small methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists adopt this method. We illustrate the framework with a large dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight other possible usages.

As such, comparing ecological networks along environmental gradients represents a promising new research avenue to understand the organization of life. Variation in the position and intensity of links within networks along environmental gradients may be driven by turnover in species composition, by variation in species abundances and by abiotic influences on species interactions. While investigating changes in species composition has a long tradition, so far only a limited number of studies have examined changes in species interactions between networks, often with differing approaches. Here, we review studies investigating variation in network structures along environmental gradients, highlighting how methodological decisions about standardization can influence their conclusions. Due to their complexity, variation among ecological networks is frequently studied using properties that summarize the distribution or topology of interactions such as number of links, connectance, or modularity. These properties can either be compared directly or using a procedure of standardization. While measures of network structure can be directly related to changes along environmental gradients, standardization is frequently used to facilitate interpretation of variation in network properties by controlling for some co-variables, or via null models. Null models allow comparing the deviation of empirical networks from random expectations and are expected to provide a more mechanistic understanding of the factors shaping ecological networks when they are coupled with functional traits. As an illustration, we compare approaches to quantify the role of trait matching in driving the structure of plant-hummingbird mutualistic networks, i.e. a direct comparison, standardized by null models and hypothesis-based metaweb. Overall, our analysis warns against a comparison of studies that rely on distinct forms of standardization, as they are likely to highlight different signals. Fostering a better understanding of the analytical tools available and the signal they detect will help produce deeper insights into how and why ecological networks vary along environmental gradients.","DOI":"10.1111/brv.12366","ISSN":"1469-185X","language":"eng","author":[{"family":"Pellissier","given":"Loïc"},{"family":"Albouy","given":"Camille"},{"family":"Bascompte","given":"Jordi"},{"family":"Farwig","given":"Nina"},{"family":"Graham","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Loreau","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Maglianesi","given":"Maria Alejandra"},{"family":"Melián","given":"Carlos J."},{"family":"Pitteloud","given":"Camille"},{"family":"Roslin","given":"Tomas"},{"family":"Rohr","given":"Rudolf"},{"family":"Saavedra","given":"Serguei"},{"family":"Thuiller","given":"Wilfried"},{"family":"Woodward","given":"Guy"},{"family":"Zimmermann","given":"Niklaus E."},{"family":"Gravel","given":"Dominique"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,22]]},"PMID":"28941124","container-title-short":"Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc"},

This article is intended for beginners who are interested in programming their own network visualizations, or for those curious about some of the basic mechanics of graph visualization. Four easy-to-program network layout techniques are discussed, with details given for implementing each one: force-directed node-link diagrams, arc diagrams, adjacency matrices, and circular layouts. A Java applet demonstrating these layouts, with open source code, is available at http://www.michaelmcguffin.com/research/simpleNetVis/. The end of this article also briefly surveys research topics in graph visualization, pointing readers to references for further reading.","DOI":"10.1109/TST.2012.6297585","author":[{"family":"McGuffin","given":"M.

Avian fruit consumption may ensure plant reproductive success when frugivores show consistent preference patterns and effectively remove and disperse seeds. In this study we examined avian fruit preferences and their seed-removal services at five study sites in north-central Puerto Rico. At each site, we documented the diet of seven common fruit-eating avian species from February to September 1998. Using foraging observations and area-based estimates of fruit abundance, we examined preference patterns of birds. We found that 7 out of 68 fleshy-fruited plant species were responsible for most of the fruit diet of birds. Seventeen plant species were preferred and four of them were repeatedly preferred across several study sites and times by at least one avian species. Preferred plant species comprised a small percentage of fleshy fruits at each site (<15% in four out of five study sites), but showed extended phenology patterns. The quantity of seeds removed by frugivore species was not strictly related to preferences. Some frugivores showing no preference could effectively remove more seeds from plants at some locations than species exhibiting constancy in their patterns of preference. Only two frugivores, Euphonia musica and Vireo altiloquous, removed most of the seeds of plants for which they exhibited repeated preference across the landscape. Preference patterns, particularly those exhibiting consistency in space and time for plant species having prolonged fruiting periods, may have important mechanistic consequences for the persistence, succession, and regeneration of tropical plant communities.","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-002-1087-1","DOI":"10.1007/s00442-002-1087-1","ISSN":"0029-8549, 1432-1939","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Carlo","given":"Tomás A."},{"family":"Collazo","given":"Jaime A."},{"family":"Groom","given":"Martha J."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,1,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,19]]},"title-short":"Avian fruit preferences across a Puerto Rican forested landscape","container-title-short":"Oecologia"},

  {"id":"SimmSwee18","type":"article-journal","title":"bmotif: a package for counting motifs in bipartite networks","source":"DataCite","abstract":"Bipartite networks are widely-used to represent a diverse range of species interactions, such as pollination, herbivory, parasitism and seed dispersal. The structure of these networks is usually characterised by calculating one or more metrics that capture different aspects of network architecture. While these metrics capture useful properties of networks, they only consider structure at the scale of the whole network (the macro-scale) or individual species (the micro-scale). 'Meso-scale' structure between these scales is usually ignored, despite representing ecologically-important interactions. Network motifs are a framework for capturing this meso-scale structure and are gaining in popularity. However, there is no software available in R, the most popular programming language among ecologists, for conducting motif analyses in bipartite networks. Similarly, no mathematical formalisation of bipartite motifs has been developed. Here we introduce bmotif: a package for counting motifs, and species positions within motifs, in bipartite networks. Our code is primarily an R package, but we also provide MATLAB and Python code of the core functionality. The software is based on a mathematical framework where, for the first time, we derive formal expressions for motif frequencies and the frequencies with which species occur in different positions within motifs. This framework means that analyses with bmotif are fast, making motif methods compatible with the permutational approaches often used in network studies, such as null model analyses. We describe the package and demonstrate how it can be used to conduct ecological analyses, using two examples of plant-pollinator networks. We first use motifs to examine the assembly and disassembly of an Arctic plant-pollinator community, and then use them to compare the roles of native and introduced plant species in an unrestored site in Mauritius. bmotif will enable motif analyses of a wide range of bipartite ecological networks, allowing future research to characterise these complex networks without discarding important meso-scale structural detail.","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/302356","DOI":"10.1101/302356","author":[{"family":"Simmons","given":"Benno I"},{"family":"Sweering","given":"Michelle J.
