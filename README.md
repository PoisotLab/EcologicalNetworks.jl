# EcologicalNetworks.jl

`EcologicalNetworks` is being replaced by [`SpeciesInteractionNetworks`](https://github.com/PoisotLab/SpeciesInteractionNetworks.jl), currently in-development. See https://github.com/PoisotLab/EcologicalNetworks.jl/issues/212 for more information.

You can *still* install the package from the Julia registry.
